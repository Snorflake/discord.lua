LuaJIT API Wrapper for Discord

Allows you to easily write bots and other things for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) in LuaJIT.

This is a Work in Progress, and is by no means finished/usable. There is some documentation, but it's still not recommended to use this until it's in a more complete state.

```lua
discord = require 'discord.init'

myClient = discord.Client:new()

-- For the love of god, don't store the password in a GitHub repo.
if myClient:login('email', 'password') then

	print('Logged in!')

	local serverList = myClient:getServerList()
	print('First Server Name: ' .. serverList[1].name)

	-- First Server Name: Y[e]

	local channelList = myClient:getChannelList(serverList[1].id)
	print('First Channel Name: ' .. channelList[1].name)

	-- First Channel Name: general

	myClient:sendMessage('I can send messages!', channelList[1].id)

	-- # general: VideahBot: I can send messages!
	
	myClient.on_message = function(channel, id, username, msg)
	
		if(msg == "test") then myClient:sendMessage("test!", channel)
	end
	
	myClient:run()

end
```

# FAQ

##### Can I use this for Lua (Insert version other than LuaJIT here)?
 
 At the moment, no because **discord.lua** uses [luajit-request](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/luajit-request) to communicate with Discord's API. This could possibly be changed to LuaSockets + LuaSec, but I currently don't have the time to do that. If you feel like doing it yourself, replace the functionality inside `wrapper.lua` with whatever other lib you want.
 
##### Help, discord.lua isn't working, but was working before!

The Discord API isn't finalized yet, if something gets changed, I have to change it too. 

Come back later after I fix it, and make sure you're always on the latest version of **discord.lua**
